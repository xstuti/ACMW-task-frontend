I started this project out by learning basics about git and github from the given resources. I moved onto learning basic HTML, few properties of CSS and Javascript.
The project given was to construct a to-do list using HTML, CSS and JS where the user could add, delete, group and strikethrough tasks upon completion, along with a note-taking space.
I started off with writing the basic html syntax for the skeleton of a to-do list, including the heading, space to enter new tasks and a button. Next I tried to construct the logic for addition of new tasks using appendchild method. I added the textarea for taking notes right after that, making sure the notes were saved in the local storage. I added a new button with the creation of every new task with the purpose of deleting the task by using remove (). After addition of all this, I worked on allowing the user to mark the items as completed by clicking on them (toggling), by using the CSS styling called line-through.
In the end, I added a lot more CSS styling to the container such as changing background colours, fixing the alignment of text and notebox, padding, margins.
